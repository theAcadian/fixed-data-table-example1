This repo has a couple of components built using fixed-data-table-2 React component from
https://github.com/schrodinger/fixed-data-table-2
1) MyTable component
- uses hardcoded data
- columns have different types of cells - text, link etc
2) InfiniteScrollExample component
- uses data generated by fakr
- 2nd column is an image
- infinite scroll

Note 
- both the above examples have been written by looking at the 'examples' provided in https://github.com/schrodinger/fixed-data-table-2 repo
- however my examples are using the least amount of code and files (so that I can understand what is going on)
